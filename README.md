# How to work
We decided to work as it is in tech company. We will create issues for everything we want to implement to our game. Each issue is linked to a branch. When the issue is done, we asked for a pull request to merge the code with develop branch. The pull request has to be accepted by one person to be merge with develop. 
To merge develop on main, everybody has to accept the pull request
